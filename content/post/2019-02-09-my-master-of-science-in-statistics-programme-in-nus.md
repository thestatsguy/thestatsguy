I have gotten quite a couple of questions regarding my current [MSc Statistics programme](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/index.php/prospective-students/graduate-programme/m-sc-by-coursework-programme) in NUS. Here are some broadstroke information about the programme and how I am approaching it.

* I'm doing the MSc by Coursework programme, which means a research thesis is not part of my curriculum. A MSc by Research option is available.

* Under the Coursework programme, there is a Track 1 (40MC) programme and a Track 2 (80MC) one. Basically dependent on whether you have a Honours in your Bachelor's degree. I'm doing the Track 1 programme - 40MC is equivalent to 10 modules. Under usual circumstances, it takes 2 full-time semesters to finish 10 modules, i.e. 1 academic year. Semesters run as per typical undergraduate semesters in Singapore.

* There's also the part-time option, where one would take 4 to 5 semesters to finish the 10 modules - 5 semesters is basically 2 modules x 5 semesters = 10 modules.

* I'm on the part-time programme. Personally, 3 modules on a part-time basis per semester is too much for me to handle - so I opt to finish my MSc in 5 semesters, or 2.5 academic years.

* I'm currently in my 4th semester, so would be finishing the programme requirements by Dec 2019 and graduate during July 2020 (commencement).

* For MSc Statistics, lectures typically run from 7pm to 10pm weeknights. Each module has 1 lecture per week, with the typical workload of tutorials, homework assignments, individual or group projects, subjected to respective lecturer's discretion.

* Lastly, the programme [cost](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/info/gd/GDTuitionCurrent.pdf) <b>$2,500 per semester for Singaporeans who are taking this MSc programme as their first higher qualification programme under the [MOE Subsidy](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/info/gd/GD-Eligibility-Guidelines.pdf)</b>. Yes it's pretty value for money if you ask me. This tuition fee amount is not unique to MSc Statistics, and is general to many other programmes in NUS, again provided if you belong to the above category.

My experience with the programme is a positive one so far.  Difficulty and commitment level is within my comfort zone, and I managed to learn quite a couple of new things. Modules that I have taken include:

* Applied Data Mining
* Advanced Statistical Methods in Finance
* Spatial Statistics
* Statistical Analysis of Networks
* Experimental Design

Also, in any case, it feels good to be a student again. Each time I go to my stats lecture after a long day of work, it <em>almost</em> always feels therapeutic. Yea, almost.

Finally, if you are looking to advance your data science street cred via a postgraduate degree, this is just one of many options, even within NUS or Singapore. Do your research wisely before committing to any!

<p>This is Part 2 from the post "<a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2019/05/20/reits-101-introduction-to-real-estate-investment-trusts/">REITs 101: Introduction to real estate investment trusts – Part&nbsp;1</a>". Be sure to check that out before going further here.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my previous post, I started talking about the real estate investment trusts, or Reits for short, in the following fashion:</p>

<h2>3. Why invest in Reits?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Reits allow for property exposure without the significant hassle of property ownership.</li><li>Reits are most commonly thought of as a source of passive income stream, and rightfully so. As we pointed out in Part 1 of this 101, Reits are obligated to pay out a minimum of 90% of its income as distributions to enjoy tax exemptions. Suffice to say that the math works out for the Reit manager to indeed pay out at least 90%. This obligation is viewed as a plus point for retail investors as a consistent passive income. This is in addition to the fact that most Reits distribute on a quarterly basis.</li><li>Because the relatively high yields (~6-8%), Reits can play a part in a retiree's holdings, where passive income and/or principal drawback kicks in. Instead of selling of units, Reits function as a perpetual income stream, of course provided that you have accumulated enough units during your career years.</li><li>Unlike evaluating companies coming from a variety of industries, from e-commerce to shipping, Reits are relatively homogeneous and easier to understand. The notion of buying and managing a property, then collect rental income is much easier to grasp than e.g. how Medicare and Medicaid policy changes will affect the outlook of pharmaceutical companies. This relative ease makes it more straightforward to evaluate Reits, and act on your decision.</li><li>In addition to high yields, Reits also avail themselves to capital gains and losses. Reits have been performing well since the second half of 2018 and continues to do so. Make of that what you will.</li></ul>

<h2>4. What are the different types of Reits?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reits are typically thought of as coming under these five categories:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Retail Reits</strong> are those comprising of shopping malls, focusing on the retail sector. Example Reit: <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/c38u.si/">CapitaMall Trust</a>.</li><li><strong>Commercial Reits</strong> go for commercial properties, such as office buildings. Example Reit: <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/t82u.si/">Suntect Reit</a>.</li><li><strong>Industrial Reits</strong> consist of properties like factories, warehouses and other specialized facilities. Example Reit: <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/me8u.si/">Mapletree Industrial Trust</a>.</li><li><strong>Hospitality Reits</strong> are the ones with hotels and serviced apartments. Example Reit: <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/q1p.si/">Ascendas hTrust</a> (a stapled security).</li><li><strong>Healthcare Reits</strong> are, well, hospitals and other healthcare facilities like medical centers or nursing homes. Example Reit: <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AW9U.si/">First Reit</a>.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can imagine, each category of Reits would flourish or suffer under whichever prevailing economic conditions. The clearest example would be that hospitality Reits would typically suffer during economic downturns, where consumers are less likely to travel (discretionary spending). High unemployment numbers could mean lower occupancy in commercial Reits, while a boost from the government to transform the country into a medical tourism hub would do well for healthcare Reits. As such, these broad economic and policy changes plays significant role in Reit evaluation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is also a bunch of Reit-ETFs, such as the <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLR.SI">Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF</a>, which I personally don't fancy - it's kind of "fee-on-top-of-fee". <a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2019/01/13/a-guide-to-dollar-cost-averaging-in-singapore-part-1/">Using regular saving plans products like the POEMS Shares Builder Plans</a> can allow us to assemble <a href="https://www.poems.com.sg/rsp/#counters">a diverse portfolio of Reits</a> without the ETF expense ratio.</p>

<h2>5. How to evaluate a Reit</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to their homogeneity, there are a number of standardized ways of Reit evaluation, with the use of a number of metrics that capture different aspects of a Reit. I wouldn't be going too in-depth here as I would like to explore this topic in greater detail in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some ways in which Reits are evaluated:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Distribution per Unit (DPU)</strong>. The DPU is simply the distributed amount to unitholders during e.g. quarterly distributions. For example, the most recent distribution from <a href="https://www.dividends.sg/view/C38U">CapitaMall Trust</a> (C38U) in May 2019 was 0.0444 per unit, which is a quarterly yield (see 2. below) and yield-to-date of 1.83%.</li><li><strong>Distribution Yield</strong>. Slightly different from DPU is the yield. The yield is simply your dividends divided by your principal, i.e. instead of having units as a denominator in DPU, we are talking here about the price of the Reit. More important than maximizing yield (the so-called <a href="https://www.fool.com/retirement/2018/01/28/what-is-a-dividend-trap.aspx">dividend trap</a>) is to look for stable and growing distributions. An increasing yield over time could mean that the Reit is stable, and is able to attract tenants. For example, the yield of C38U grew from 3.44% in 2013 to 7.68% in 2018 full year.</li><li><strong>Price-to-NAV</strong>. The price-to-NAV ratio, also known as book value, compares the market valuation of the Reit to the value of the Reit in its books. NAV stands for net asset value, which captures the amount of money, in principle, that the Reit would have if the Reit manager liquidates all assets and returns the money back to investors. We would consider any price-to-NAV ratio of less than 1 to signal undervaluation by the market. Following are some examples (as of May 2019):<ul><li><a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/t82U.SI/key-statistics?p=t82U.SI">Suntec Reit</a> - 0.87</li><li><a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/k71U.SI/key-statistics?p=k71U.SI">Keppel Reit</a> - 0.85</li><li><a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ME8U.SI/key-statistics?p=ME8U.SI">Mapletree Industrial Trust</a> - 1.39</li></ul></li><li><strong>Gearing Ratio</strong>. Also known as leverage, the gearing ratio is the ratio between the amount of debt divided by the Reit's total assets. Recall we talked about the maximum gearing ratio of a Reit in Singapore has to be less than 45%. Generally, we are seeing an average of &lt; 40% amongst our S-Reits.</li><li><strong>Weighted Lease Average Expiry (WALE)</strong>. As the name suggests, WALE is simply the mean remaining lease duration, weighted by the rental income, in the Reit's portfolio. Needless to say, a WALE of 10 years is better than that of 5 years. WALE typically differs depending on the type of Reit - for example, industrial Reits tend to have longer leases than a retail Reit.</li><li><strong>Capitalization Rate</strong>. Also know as property yield, the cap rate simply captures the income derived from the properties (net operating income) to the value of the properties.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there's more. Some of these metrics, like WALE, are obviously Reit-specific, while others apply to most if not all listed company stocks. I will go over more of these metrics, as well as viewing Reits under a fundamental analysis lens, in a later, post-101 series of posts.</p>

<p>This is a worked example on how to set up SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio, and a ODBC connection with R.</p>
<p>Step 1: Install SQL Server from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads" class="uri">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads</a>. The SQL Server 2017 Express was good enough for me to run some analysis and modelling on my own. Once done, you should have a screen like this:</p>

<p>Step 2: Click on the “Install SSMS” button. SSMS stands for SQL Server Management Studio. Once done, connect to the server:</p>

<p>Step 3: Create a database on the server. You may follow the steps given in this page as a quick start: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/connect-query-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017" class="uri">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/connect-query-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017</a>. If you do, you should have a database created named “TutorialDB” and a table named “Customers”.</p>
<p>Step 4: Install and load the RODBC package in R.</p>

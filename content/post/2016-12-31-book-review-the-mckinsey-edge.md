The McKinsey Edge by Shu Hattori is a collection of "principles" that the author collected while he was at
consultant at McKinsey. The forty-odd principles in the book, while easily understood, stood out
when they are collated together in a single book, as many productivity and professional hacks
strung together. A rather interesting read.

Following are his principles divided into four chapters, and in bold are those that I thought to be
particularly useful, and would like to expound on them in future writings.

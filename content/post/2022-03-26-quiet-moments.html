<h3>
<strong>One</strong>
</h3>
<p>Taking a long bus ride.</p>
<p>Got a seat in the upper deck. Plenty of seats.</p>
<p>In no rush. Ample time.</p>
<p>Relying on public transport. EZ-Link card in my pocket.</p>
<p>Enjoying the scenes. Recognizing familiar places, discovering new ones. Took a mental note.</p>
<p>No one speaks to me. I speak to no one.</p>
<p>Serene anonymity.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Two</strong>
</h3>
<p>Walking in a quiet mall. Or in the streets.</p>
<p>Weekday. Just after lunchtime.</p>
<p>Running an errand. Get it done.</p>
<p>No one knows me, especially with the help of a surgical mask.</p>
<p>Enjoying the scenes.</p>
<p>No one speaks to me. I speak to no one.</p>
<p>Serene anonymity.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Three</strong>
</h3>
<p>A food court. Many selections of food.</p>
<p>Patrons scattered, an early lunch or an early dinner.</p>
<p>Quiet white noise of chattering patrons and vendors. Mandarin. Hokkien. English.</p>
<p>Using my Kopitiam card for a discount.</p>
<p>Chose a seat. A clear view at the expanse of the food court.</p>
<p>Cheap food. Strong kopi-c-kosong.</p>
<p>No one speaks to me. I speak to no one.</p>
<p>Serene anonymity.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Four</strong>
</h3>
<p>Sunday.</p>
<p>Contemplating life. Contemplating finances.</p>
<p>Being single. All in order.</p>
<p>No emotional baggage. No anxiety-inducing liabilities.</p>
<p>Ready for the future. Living within means.</p>
<p>No need to speak to anyone. No one speaks to me.</p>
<p>Serene anonymity.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Five</strong>
</h3>
<p>Hobbies. Photography. Nature. Books. Volunteering. Arts. Culture. Knowledge. Writing. Philosophy. Life. No need to speak. Just learn.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Six</strong>
</h3>
<p>A hike. A long hike.</p>
<p>MacRitchie Trail.</p>
<p>Shaded from the hot sun by tall trees.</p>
<p>Few are on the trail.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat rolled down my chest.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath through my nostrils.</p>
<p>Exhale through my mouth.</p>
<p>A sip of water.</p>
<p>A Common Mormon flutters by.</p>
<p>Birds sing from high up the canopy.</p>
<p>No one speaks to me. I speak to no one.</p>
<p>Serene anonymity.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Seven</strong>
</h3>
<p>A high rise condomium in the city. Or in Harbourfront. Carribean at Keppel Bay.</p>
<p>Green-tinted windows. Squarish.</p>
<p>Squarish apartments.</p>
<p>A study, a room to write. Full of books of every kind (like Montaigneâ€™s library).</p>
<p>An armchair. Comfortable.</p>
<p>A sea view. A clean, organized view for inspirations.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Eight</strong>
</h3>
<p>A writer returns home. Back to the study.</p>
<p>Bookcases line the walls of his study.</p>
<p>A desk faces the window; an unblocked view puts him at ease.</p>
<p>Elevates his perception, into a fictional universe in his mind.</p>
<p>No one knows where he lives. No one knows where he is.</p>
<p>No need to speak.</p>
<p>Serene anonymity.</p>

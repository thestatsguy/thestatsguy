In my work so far, there are typically a few type of tasks:

<li>Analytics tasks (planning, architecture, setup, coding etc)
<li>Writing (documentations, reflections)
<li>Desktop research
<li>Emails (replying, drafting new ones)
<li>Ideations
<li>Team huddles
<li>External meetings with customers
<li>Internal project meetings
<li>Preparing decks and presentations
<li>Organising materials
<li>Admin

I think they can divided into four quadrants:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td style="vertical-align:top">
  <b>High amount of visible results, low value</b>
  <ul>
 	   <li>Emails (replying, drafting new ones)</li>
 	   <li>Organising materials</li>
	</ul>
  </td>
  <td style="vertical-align:top">
  <b>High amount of visible results, high value</b>
  <ul>
	<li>Analytics tasks (coding, planning)</li>
	<li>Writing</li>
	<li>Preparing decks and presentations</li>
	<li>Customer meetings</li>
	</ul>
  </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <td style="vertical-align:top">
  <b>Low amount of visible results, low value</b>
  <ul>
	<li>Admin</li>
	</ul>
  </td>
  <td style="vertical-align:top">
  <b>Low amount of visible results, high value</b>
  <ul>
	<li>Desktop research</li>
	<li>Ideations, brainstorming</li>
	<li>Team huddles</li>
	<li>Internal project meetings</li>
	</ul>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

There's a lot of unpack here, so one by one:

* Visible results: a deck, an email, a document, a discussion with potential customers - tangible stuff
* Value: high value means generating a good idea, building strong relationships with customers or fellow colleagues in the same or different team, getting a clearer idea of something that allows you to move forward from current status quo
* A good day at work would be to spend most if not all of your time in Quadrant 1, generating both value and results
* Quadrant 2 gives high value because these are the types of tasks that spark the team and yourself off towards a good week or month. These tasks generally give ideas and directions, and hence high value

As a morning person, my energy dwindle towards the end of the day, especially with a trough after lunch. Within this framework there must be a way to optimise my productivity in a work day.

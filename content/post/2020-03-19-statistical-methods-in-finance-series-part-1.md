It's a sleepless night tonight, so I decided to write a little bit. This will be the first part 1 of a series that I would like to write about, circling around the use of statistical methods in finance. Most of the content that I will be exploring would originate from one of my M.Sc. Statistics modules, ST5218 Advanced Statistical Methods in Finance. I was taught by Prof Xia Yingcun when I did this module.

Back in January 2017, I first seriously considered taking up a postgraduate degree, as a means to improve myself and continue learning. Well, it wasn't a long and hard decision, really, as I had and still have the freedom, the capacity and the means to study more.

> I am leaning towards taking a part-time Masters this year in 2017. Points of considerations:

> * Masters or PhD?
> * Full-time or part-time?
> * (If masters) technical or non-technical?
> * (If full-time) Overseas or local?
> * (If local) NUS or NTU?

>Full-time is personally a non-option for me, as I don’t see the financial sense in taking a sabbatical to pursue a full-time programme. That leaves full-time and overseas out.

> Based on what I know about a PhD programme, part-time PhD sounds like a nightmare. That leaves part-time Masters in Singapore as my option.

> Next question: technical or non-technical? Well I am leaning towards to doing something with technical content when studying - non-technical content can be picked up most of the time simply by being widely read and learning from work experiences. This means statistics or computing for me.

> And NUS is probably the better choice than NTU. SMU is not in my consideration.

> So for now, my choice is going to be M.Sc. Statistics from NUS.

<center>Quoting myself in Jan 2017, [here](https://thestatsguy.rbind.io/post/2019/02/09/short-my-master-of-science-in-statistics-programme-in-nus/). Was I rigourous in my decision-making? Hmm...</center>

So I decided to go with a Master of Science in Statistics programme in NUS, and starting my first semester in August 2017. I then took 5 semesters, all the way to December 2019, to complete the programme. Today, I have since happily graduated and have had a good experience with the programme.

Around midway through the programme, I wrote a short review on the logistics and my experience of the programme so far.

> I have gotten quite a couple of questions regarding my current MSc Statistics programme in NUS. Here are some broadstroke information about the programme and how I am approaching it.

> * I’m doing the MSc by Coursework programme, which means a research thesis is not part of my curriculum. A MSc by Research option is available.

> * Under the Coursework programme, there is a Track 1 (40MC) programme and a Track 2 (80MC) one. Basically dependent on whether you have a Honours in your Bachelor’s degree. I’m doing the Track 1 programme - 40MC is equivalent to 10 modules. Under usual circumstances, it takes 2 full-time semesters to finish 10 modules, i.e. 1 academic year. Semesters run as per typical undergraduate semesters in Singapore.

> * There’s also the part-time option, where one would take 4 to 5 semesters to finish the 10 modules - 5 semesters is basically 2 modules x 5 semesters = 10 modules.

> * I’m on the part-time programme. Personally, 3 modules on a part-time basis per semester is too much for me to handle - so I opt to finish my MSc in 5 semesters, or 2.5 academic years.

> * I’m currently in my 4th semester, so would be finishing the programme requirements by Dec 2019 and graduate during July 2020 (commencement).

> * For MSc Statistics, lectures typically run from 7pm to 10pm weeknights. Each module has 1 lecture per week, with the typical workload of tutorials, homework assignments, individual or group projects, subjected to respective lecturer’s discretion.

> * Lastly, the programme cost $2,500 per semester for Singaporeans who are taking this MSc programme as their first higher qualification programme under the MOE Subsidy. Yes it’s pretty value for money if you ask me. This tuition fee amount is not unique to MSc Statistics, and is general to many other programmes in NUS, again provided if you belong to the above category.

> My experience with the programme is a positive one so far. Difficulty and commitment level is within my comfort zone, and I managed to learn quite a couple of new things. Modules that I have taken include:

> * Applied Data Mining
> * Advanced Statistical Methods in Finance
> * Spatial Statistics
> * Statistical Analysis of Networks
> * Experimental Design

> Also, in any case, it feels good to be a student again. Each time I go to my stats lecture after a long day of work, it almost always feels therapeutic. Yea, almost.

> Finally, if you are looking to advance your data science street cred via a postgraduate degree, this is just one of many options, even within NUS or Singapore. Do your research wisely before committing to any!

Well, this post first appeared on my WordPress blog [here](https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2019/02/09/my-master-of-science-in-statistics-programme-in-nus/), and I realised that this post on WordPress turned out to be one of the top results in a number of Google searches on this topic. The other search results are of course dominated by links to NUS and Faculty of Science itself.

* ["nus msc statistics review"](https://www.google.com/search?q=nus+msc+statistics+review)
* ["nus msc statistics"](https://www.google.com/search?q=nus+msc+statistics)
* ["how is nus msc statistics"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+is+nus+msc+statistics)

Turns out that I got a decent number of views on this post. Not bad considering that I don't expect much traffic on my blog.

#### A fuller review

Since there is **_some_** interest in this topic, I thought I would spend some time in this post to do a more complete review of the programme.

* Review on the stats modules that I took
* How I went about my life while being a part-time student

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The objective of this post is simple - to illustrate the concept of diversification and why it’s important in asset management. We all know “not to put our eggs in one basket”, and have a diversified portfolio. Intutitively, we know that if we were to put all our money on a single stock, then we have placed a large bet on that one company. While we could instantly make it big just by having our one stock making it big, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss aversion</a> would indicate that we would rather minimize the risk of losing it all in a single stock.</p>
<p>In this sense, what divserification does to a portfolio is that it minimizes risk of the portfolio.

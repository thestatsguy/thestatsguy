# About this blog

This blog is simply an outlet for me to write, and in the process, reflect and analyse, about things in life that I naturally leaned towards – statistics, machine learning, investing, personal finance, analyzing financial data, and stoicism.

* __Machine learning and statistics__: the blog was so named “the stats guy” largely because that became my nickname amongst some friends. Also, there’s an increasing emphasis on hacking and e.g. layer-stacking in deep learning, with too little statistical groundings, as above. The subtle disregard of statistics in data science is unhealthy to say the least, and so here I write about certain ideas and principles that are, for the most part, neglected in analyzing and modelling data. Finally, I figured it’s more liberating to write behind a pseudonym of sorts.
* __Finance, retail investing in Singapore__: there are plenty of materials out there regarding retail investing in US/UK, but not enough for those of us who live in Singapore. So I think aloud about this topic here as well.
* __[Statistical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_finance)__: it’s sort of the overlap between my data science/statistics background and me managing my own money, so this is fun to me and comes naturally.
* __[Corporate rat race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race)__: in here, I write a little bit being in the corporate rat race, how to survive, how to (try to) excel, and what's the endgame for everyone (including myself).
* __[Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)__: or rather, applied Stoicism. I spend some time exploring how Stoicism is helpful for ordinary people like me.

# About me
I’m of course a Singaporean, living and working in Singapore, got my B.Sc and M.Sc from the National University of Singapore, and work as a data scientist in a Boston start-up. By all modern and millennial standards, especially that of in Singapore, I’m an extremely boring person and spend most of my waking (and highly routinized if I am not travelling for work) hours on the few things I enjoy the most, such as those listed above. So fortunately, my life is a little less boring than myself.

By the way, neither of my B.Sc or M.Sc has anything remotely related to business, finance, or investing. Nor am I in any sorts of professional role that justifies my giving of any sorts of financial advice. That means you should take all my opinions as a pinch of salt and do your own research. I am, however, sufficiently trained in looking at numbers and cryptic computer languages (or at least, I dare to claim so), and my opinions are largely backed by some levels of analysis of available data.

In any case, if you would like a chat, you can drop me a note at thestatsguy90[at]gmail[dot]com. If you are interested in the analyses I did or the code I wrote, you can drop by my [Github](https://github.com/thestatsguy).

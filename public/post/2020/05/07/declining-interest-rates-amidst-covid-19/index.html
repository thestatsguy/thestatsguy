<p>As Covid-19 continues to wreck havoc in many countries around the world, including the US, massive sell-offs haven taken place in Wall Street and other markets.</p>

<p>In a move to protect the US economy from the effects of the pandemic, the US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice during March 2020 - <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/in-an-emergency-move-us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-to-12496552">first in early March</a>, cutting rates by 50 basis points to a targeted range of 1% to 1.25%, then <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-to-near-zero-coordinates-with-other-central">another cut in mid March</a> to a targeted range of 0% to 0.25%. At the same time, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-to-zero-and-launches-massive-700-billion-quantitative-easing-program.html">quantitative easing</a> (QE) programme was also launched, entailing US$700 billion worth of asset purchases comprising US Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, i.e. the Fed buys these securities from the market, and basically inject liquidity back into the market.</p>

<p>The last time the Fed has taken steps similiar to this, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut.html">was during the 08 Global Financial Crisis</a>.</p>

<h4 id="impact-on-singapore-and-ordinary-singaporeans">Impact on Singapore and ordinary Singaporeans</h4>

<p>Inevitably, interest rates in Singapore (SIBOR, SOR) have always been closely tied to US Fed rates, and hence these rates have been falling as well. For retail investors and lay Singaporeans like myself, there are several effects.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Falling mortgage rates - housing loans will be cheaper, and refinancing may be viable if it&rsquo;s an option for you.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/some-singapore-retail-investors-using-cheap-cash-to-load-up-on-stocks">Or, you can even to go on leverage</a></p></li>

<li><p>Local banks and the STI suffer - our favorite DBS, OCBC, and UOB will have their Net Interest Margin decrease, affecting their earnings. And with <a href="https://sginvestors.io/market/sgx-share-price-performance/straits-times-index-constituents">~35% of the STI</a> is made up of these banks (at time of writing), the STI will drop as well. Of course the banks are not the only reason why the STI suffers.</p></li>

<li><p>Deposit account rates fall - likewise, our favorite DBS Multiplier, OCBC 360, UOB One, and the likes will see a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/banks-here-cut-deposit-rates-in-line-with-global-markets">cut in interest rates</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Singapore Government Securities rates fall - additionally, SGS bonds and SSBs will also see a decrease in yield.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, SSB rates have fallen significantly over the past months, since early 2019. The June 2020 issue of SSB has a firstr</p>

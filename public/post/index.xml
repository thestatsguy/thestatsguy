      <description>In this post, I would like to give an overview of the principles and concepts in the fundamental analysis of stocks.
What is fundamental analysis? Well, fundamental analysis (FA) is the analysis of the fundamentals of a company. The fundamentals of the company are trying to capture essentially the health of the company, in the present and future. The objective of FA is to discern a point of view on the current and future prospects of a company – the actionability from this point of view is of course whether to buy (or short-sell) the stock.</description>

      <description>In statistical finance (as well as in certain areas in social science), stylized facts are empirical observations summarized in a theory-like form, and are generally representative under broad circumstances.
Stylized facts are commonly used in statistical finance to address and summarize phenomenon directly observed from historical data, and explainable with a certain level of theoretical consistency and logic (&#34;... this makes sense to me&#34;). Stylized facts may often guide investigations and explorations into certain topics of interest, functioning perhaps as assumptions to be either built upon or proven otherwise.</description>

      <description>I have gotten quite a couple of questions regarding my current MSc Statistics programme in NUS. Here are some broadstroke information about the programme and how I am approaching it.
 I&amp;rsquo;m doing the MSc by Coursework programme, which means a research thesis is not part of my curriculum. A MSc by Research option is available.
 Under the Coursework programme, there is a Track 1 (40MC) programme and a Track 2 (80MC) one.</description>

      <description>The Machine Learning Life Cycle from DataRobot.
I recently came across this page in the DataRobot Artificial Intelligence Wiki. If you don&#39;t already know, DataRobot is currently one of the top automated machine learning platform in the market, with emphasis on supervised learning and citizen data science. I am quite a big fan of their platform - even though I don&#39;t use it in my work, I believe that they and their competitors in the market are heading into the right direction towards automated machine learning.</description>

      <description>Putting models together in an ensemble learning fashion is a popular technique amongst Data Scientists
Ensemble learning is the simultaneous use of multiple predictive models to arrive at a single prediction, based on a collective decision made together by all models in the ensemble. It&#39;s a common and popular technique used in predictive modelling, especially when individual models are failing to produce the required performance levels, in terms of e.g. accuracy.</description>

<h3 id="design-inspiration">Design inspiration</h3>

<p>A run on the bank is a situation where businesses and/or ordinary folks like ourselves, lose confidence and trust in the banks where our deposits are held. In this case, we are the lenders, lending the banks our money, in return for safe keeping and interest rates.</p>

<p>If a significant number of us lose confidence in the banks that we deposit our cash in, we may all choose to withdraw our money from the banks, preferring to hold physical cash instead.</p>

<p>Now, in case you haven&rsquo;t realize, banks these days do not actually hold most, if not all, the cash that have been deposited by depositors!</p>

<p>Most of these funds are invested in assets - and not all liquid in nature, like corporate debt or government/municipal bonds (think Singapore Government Securities). Some are highly illiquid, such as land, infrastructure or properties.</p>

<p>Therefore, when all of us decide to go to the banks to withdraw our cash, the banks may not be able to fulfil their end of the stick and return our money! When this happens, more people lose confidence, resulting in more withdrawals - a worsening feedback loop.</p>

<p><em>Technically</em>, in order to reduce the probability of bank runs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III">Basel III</a> was first purposed in 2010, just after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis</a>. Under Basel III, banks are obligated to hold, at any point in time, sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover total outflow (e.g. withdrawals, debt obligations) in any 30-day period. This is known as the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity-coverage-ratio.asp#:~:text=The%20liquidity%20coverage%20ratio%20is,its%20short%2Dterm%20financial%20obligations.">Liquidity Coverage Ratio</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Run on the Bank is one of the early cards that we designed, with simplistic wording but potentially devastating effects. There are two copies of the Run on the Bank in the game.</p>

<p>The illustration on the card shows hordes of deposit holders having rushed to the bank to withdraw their money.</p>

<p><em>Did you know?</em> The first ever run on the bank happened in AD 33, in the Roman Empire - the first financial crisis in the history of man. There were numerous factors contributing to the bank run, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sinking of ships filled with assets and treasures belonging to a prominent banking institute, and</li>
<li>the then Roman Emperor (Tiberius), who ordered, with good reason, all Roman Senators to have at least a third of their wealth to invested in the Italian land.</li>
</ul>

<p>These and a multitude of reasons caused Roman citizens, businesses, and even the Senators to hurry to the banks and withdraw their deposits, which the banks were not able to fulfil. In the end, emperor Tiberius decided to inject cash into the Roman economy, in the form of a Quantitative Easing (yet another card in RSPM!), and resolved the first ever financial crisis in the history of man.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use">How to use</h3>

<p>Well, Run on the Bank is easily one of the most powerful cards in the game - all players, with the exception of those with Fully Hedged, lose all their Cash. The presence of this card in the game disincentivizes players from holding on to too much Cash, since there&rsquo;s a possibility of other players playing the card. It also encourages investing Cash into the markets, as Asset Classes like Stocks, Bonds, and Gold will have better returns than Cash - if invested correctly.</p>

<p>Therefore, perhaps a game of RSPM is well played when players always cognizant about the presence of Run on the Bank - without the card seeing play at all..</p>

<p>Of course, the other way to play is to hold on to this card in your hand, or use Hatching a Plan, to search for the card. Then, once both copies of Run on the Bank are found or played, you are free to hold all the Cash you like!</p>

<h1 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h1>

<p>This blog is simply an outlet for me to write, and in the process, reflect and analyse, about things in life that I naturally leaned towards – machine learning, investing, personal finances, analyzing financial data, and stoicism.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.redd.it/5193db0avbey.jpg" width="100%">
<center>Too true to be funny? – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/5si1f0/machine_learning_approaches/">a post I saw on Reddit</a></center></p>

<ul>
<li>Data science: the blog was so named “the stats guy” largely because that became my nickname amongst some friends. Also, there’s an increasing emphasis on hacking and e.g. layer-stacking in deep learning, with too little statistical groundings, as above. The subtle disregard of statistics in data science is unhealthy to say the least, and so here I write about certain ideas and principles that are, for the most part, neglected in analyzing and modelling data. Finally, I figured it’s more liberating to write behind a pseudonym of sorts.</li>
<li>Retail investing in Singapore: there are plenty of materials out there regarding retail investing in US/UK, but not enough for those of us who live in Singapore. So I think aloud about this topic here as well.</li>
<li>Statistical finance: it’s sort of the overlap between my data science/statistics background and me managing my own money, so this is fun to me and comes naturally.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a>: or rather, applied Stoicism. I spend some time exploring how Stoicism is helpful for ordinary people like me.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>I’m of course a Singaporean, living and working in Singapore, got my B.Sc and M.Sc from the National University of Singapore, and work as a data scientist in a Boston start-up. By all modern and millennial standards, especially that of in Singapore, I’m an extremely boring person and spend most of my waking (and highly routinized if I am not travelling for work) hours on the few things I enjoy the most, such as those listed above. So fortunately, my life is a little less boring than myself.</p>

<p>By the way, neither of my B.Sc or M.Sc has anything remotely related to business, finance, or investing. Nor am I in any sorts of professional role that justifies my giving of any sorts of financial advice. That means you should take all my opinions as a pinch of salt and do your own research. I am, however, sufficiently trained in looking at numbers and cryptic computer languages (or at least, I dare to claim so), and my opinions are largely backed by some levels of analysis of available data.</p>

<p>In any case, if you would like a chat, you can drop me a note at thestatsguy90[at]gmail[dot]com. If you are interested in the analyses I did or the code I wrote, you can drop by my <a href="https://github.com/thestatsguy">Github</a>.</p>

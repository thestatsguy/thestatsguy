      <description>IntroductionThis is part 2 of the statistical methods in finance series. In this installment, I would like to talk about modern portfolio theory (MPT), a key topic in finance. The first couple of lines in the MPT Wikipedia article explains it very well:
(MPT) is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. It is a formalization and extension of diversification in investing, the idea that owning different kinds of financial assets is less risky than owning only one type.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sleepless night, so I decided to write a little. This will be the first part of a series that I would like to write about, circling around the use of statistical methods in finance. Most of the content that I will be exploring would originate from one of my NUS M.Sc Statistics modules, Advanced Statistical Methods in Finance. I was taught by Prof Xia Yingcun when I did this module.</description>

      <description>In this post, I would like to give an overview of the principles and concepts in the fundamental analysis of stocks.
What is fundamental analysis? Well, fundamental analysis (FA) is the analysis of the fundamentals of a company. The fundamentals of the company are trying to capture essentially the health of the company, in the present and future. The objective of FA is to discern a point of view on the current and future prospects of a company – the actionability from this point of view is of course whether to buy (or short-sell) the stock.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will be doing a 101 dissection of the medical device industry. It’s a somewhat not-so-popular industry from the perspective of retail investing, but I have had some prior experience in this space, so it’s a tad easier for me to conduct some levels of analysis on companies in this space.
I will work through the following pointers in this piece, and hopefully at the end of it, allow the reader to have some level of appreciation for the industry as a whole.</description>

      <guid>/post/2019/05/11/short-an-uncommon-approach-in-tackling-class-imbalance/</guid>
      <description>In supervised learning, one challenged faced by data scientists is classification class imbalance, where in a binary classification problem, instances in one class severely outnumbers instances in the other. This poses a problem as model performances may be misleading: a naive example would be to always predict negative in a 10% positive-90% negative dataset - accuracy would then be 90%, but the model would be utterly useless.
The typical approaches in alleviating class imbalance include using robust metrics such as the ROC-AUC, or performing downsampling of majority class or upsampling of minority class (e.</description>

      <guid>/post/2019/04/04/short-stylized-facts-in-statistical-finance/</guid>
      <description>In statistical finance (as well as in certain areas in social science), stylized facts are empirical observations summarized in a theory-like form, and are generally representative under broad circumstances.
Stylized facts are commonly used in statistical finance to address and summarize phenomenon directly observed from historical data, and explainable with a certain level of theoretical consistency and logic (&#34;... this makes sense to me&#34;). Stylized facts may often guide investigations and explorations into certain topics of interest, functioning perhaps as assumptions to be either built upon or proven otherwise.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;m doing the MSc by Coursework programme, which means a research thesis is not part of my curriculum. A MSc by Research option is available.
 Under the Coursework programme, there is a Track 1 (40MC) programme and a Track 2 (80MC) one.</description>

Step 1: Install SQL Server from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads. The SQL Server 2017 Express was good enough for me to run some analysis and modelling on my own. Once done, you should have a screen like this:

Been wanting to do this consolidation for some time, so here goes. I won&amp;rsquo;t be touching on any language-specific questions (e.g. packages or functions), as I don&amp;rsquo;t believe they are relevant in this Google/Stack Overflow era - kind of missing the forest for the trees. Also, won&amp;rsquo;t be going over basic questions like &amp;ldquo;What is logistic regression&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;How does collaborative filtering works&amp;rdquo; or the like.</description>

Ensemble learning is the simultaneous use of multiple predictive models to arrive at a single prediction, based on a collective decision made together by all models in the ensemble. It&#39;s a common and popular technique used in predictive modelling, especially when individual models are failing to produce the required performance levels, in terms of e.g. accuracy.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAs the name suggests, random forest models basically contain an ensemble of decision tree models, with each decision tree predicting the same response variable. The response may be categorical, in which case being a classification problem, or continuous / numerical, being a regression problem.
In this short tutorial, we will go through the use of tree-based methods (decision tree, bagging model, and random forest) for both classification and regression problems.</description>

<p>In this post, I would like to give an overview of the principles and concepts in the fundamental analysis of stocks.</p>

<h2>What is fundamental analysis?</h2>

<p>Well, fundamental analysis (FA) is the analysis of the fundamentals of a company. The fundamentals of the company are trying to capture essentially the health of the company, in the present and future. The objective of FA is to discern a point of view on the current and future prospects of a company – the actionability from this point of view is of course whether to buy (or short-sell) the stock. If our FA suggests that the company is likely to perform well in the future, we would like a piece of the action.</p>

<p>In this sense, there is an inherent notion of valuation – based on our view of the stock, we could, for example, conclude that the stock is currently under-valued and is likely to grow to at least a fair valuation. Therefore, we buy. Nonetheless, we don’t know when our under-valued stock would grow to our fair valuation. It could take days, months or years.</p>

<h2>The efficient market hypothesis, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis</h2>

<p>Any current under- or over-valuation of a stock implies that the market is not valuing the stock “correctly”, and is hence inefficient. One of the dominant criticisms against FA is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). EMH states that at any point in time, the market is efficient and security prices are exactly where they should be – every security is valued correctly, taking into account all aspects of the security and the company. For example, the resultant price plunge from a JNJ lawsuit or a Boeing plane crash is exactly reflective of the inherent value of JNJ or Boeing.</p>

<p>Corollary to the EMH is as follows – it would be impossible to derive any form of “correct” valuation or insights based on e.g. the fundamentals of JNJ or Boeing, no matter how we analyse the fundamentals. Research has shown that the strong condition of the EMH is largely true (reference), and there are occasions where inefficiencies occur.</p>

<p>On the other hand, proponents of technical analysis (TA) argue that price movements are driven by signals in the historical prices themselves. TA relies on e.g. trading on momentum of the stock, and similar to the EMH, suggests that the JNJ lawsuit or Boeing plane crash has already been priced into the stock, and stock prices constantly moves to capture these news and signals.</p>

<p>Based on my current understanding on securities and prices, FA makes sense to me. As someone with scientific and statistical background, it is challenging for me to convince myself that TA is not some variant of data dredging or confirmation bias. But of course, you can always take what you will and maintain healthy skepticism.</p>

<h2>The objective of fundamental analysis</h2>

<p>As we mentioned above, the objective of FA is to discern a point of view on the current and future prospects of a company. The actionability from this point of view is of course whether to buy (or short-sell) the stock. More specifically, what are we interested in from an exercise of FA is to answer questions such as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is the company actually making money?</p></li>

<li><p>Can the company continue to make money?</p></li>

<li><p>Can the company beat its competition in time to come?</p></li>

<li><p>Is the company is able to fulfil its debt obligations?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As simple as they are crafted, these questions are difficult to tackle and sometimes give ambiguous answers, leaving the analyst to provide a subjective opinion. Personally, this is one reason why FA appeals to me – the fact that the same set of numbers can lead to different analysis and stories meant that there’s more to the performance of a company than financials, much like data scientists would use data to tell a story and derive insights.</p>

<h2>The ancient dichotomy – Quantitative and qualitative fundamentals</h2>

<p>There’s no need to further elaborate the difference between quantitative and qualitative fundamentals. While revenue, sales, and costs can be objectively measured, notions like brand loyalty, intellectual product, and management competence are hard to place a price tag on. Following table illustrates examples what we would like to look for in both aspects of FA.</p>

<p><p>This post is a 101 dissection of real estate investment trusts, REITs or Reits in short. As the full content of this topics is pretty long and I plan to make this 101 comprehensive, I will be publishing this piece in 2 parts, touching on the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<p><ol><li>What are Reits</li><li>What makes Reits different from other investment vehicles</li><li>Why invest in Reits - <em>covered in Part 2</em></li><li>What are the different types of Reits - <em>covered in Part 2</em> </li><li>How to evaluate a Reit - <em>covered in Part 2</em></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s plenty to talk about even in a 101 piece, so let&rsquo;s get straight to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->

<p><h2>1. What are Reits?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Reits, by virtue of their long form name, are essentially instruments that allow investors to get exposure to the real estate market, be it locally, regionally, or globally. The easiest way to give an explanation of what is a Reit is is to take on the perspective of the Reit manager. As the Reit manager, to start an investment trust on real estate, you would first need to secure financing from, say a bank, to finance your portfolio of properties. That&rsquo;s one portion of the financing. The other portion comes from listing the Reit in an exchange through an IPO, and get investors to invest in your Reit as a unitholder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>From there, your entire portfolio of properties are financed from these two parties and your Reit is established. Afterwhich, you would do whatever that is required to rent these properties out on a lease, and start to collect rental income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<p><h3>Reits as a passive income stream</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>And here&rsquo;s where plenty of retails investors, especially those in Singapore, have came to love Reits - Reits are obligated to pay out a minimum of 90% of its income as distributions (i.e. dividends) to enjoy tax exemptions. Suffice to say that the math works out for the Reit manager to indeed to pay at least 90%. This obligation is often viewed favorably by investors as a means to achieve consistent passive income stream - it has been suggested that Reits can be used as a <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/choosing-steady-retirement-income">supplement or even alternative to a retiree&rsquo;s annuity</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<p><h3>The different parties within a Reit</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Following illustrates clearly how each party in a Reit interacts with another. Let&rsquo;s take a brief look at each of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:image -->

<p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/-/media/moneysense/images/content-graphics-infographics/a-typical-reit-structure.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=C618E33305CB50C523C8A226DB39D2684F532A1A" alt=""/><figcaption>A typical Reit structure. <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/10/understanding-real-estate-investment-trusts-reits">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>

<!-- wp:list -->

<p><ul><li>The Trustee: the trustee, as the name suggests, is responsible for the holding of the Reit units for investors. The trustee may also ensure compliance on the Reit on behalf of unitholders, and in gist, act in all manners in the interest of unitholders.</li><li>The Reit manager: the Reit manager is the one or the team that manages the strategic oversight of the Reit and its investment strategies. A Reit manager, may for instance, decide to expand out of Singapore real estate and venture into say, the Australian market.</li><li>The Property manager: on the other hand, the property manager is in charge of the actual management of the properties, e.g. running marketing campaigns or strategizing to maximise rental income.</li><li>The Sponsor: the sponsor is basically the &ldquo;big boss&rdquo; in the Reit. They are usually big developers like <a href="https://www.capitaland.com/sg/en.html">CapitaLand</a> or <a href="http://www.mapletree.com.sg/">Mapletree</a>. They may be the ones who initially developed the properties and assets in the Reit. A sponsor, especially a larger one, would typically run and manage several Reits at once with different Reit manager teams - e.g. CapitaLand with <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/c38u.si">CapitaLand Mall Trust</a>, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/C61U.SI">CapitaLand Commercial Trust</a>, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/A68U.SI/">Ascott Residence Trust</a>, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AU8U.SI">CapitaLand Retail China Trust</a>, and <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/5180.KL/">CapitaLand Malaysia Trust</a> (listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange).</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->

<p><h2>2. Why makes Reits different from other investment vehicles?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:list -->

<p><ul><li>Fundamentally, Reits have no relations with stocks, bonds or commodities, only real estate. Therefore Reits are often thought of as an alternative asset class.</li><li>Public companies operate in accordance to typical business regulations set out by e.g. SEC in the US, and different companies operate under different guidelines for different industries, e.g. a medical devices company with the FDA. On the other hand, Reits are more strictly regulated and more homogeneous. In Singapore, <ul><li>Reits cannot undertake any development activities (e.g. <a href="https://www.reitsweek.com/2017/11/asset-enhancement-initiative.html">asset enhancement initiatives</a> or AEI) directly or indirectly, when the value of these activities are in excess of 10% of the Reit&rsquo;s portfolio value.</li><li>Reits can have a maximum leverage (i.e. gearing ratio) of 45%.</li><li>As mentioned above, Reits are obligated to pay out a minimum of 90% of its income as distributions (i.e. dividends) to enjoy tax exemptions.</li></ul></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Unlike Reits, these or equivalent measures on leverage and distributions are not applicable in public stocks or companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<p><h3>What about Reits vs physical property?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Well that&rsquo;s all good, but what about having real estate exposure by simply owning a property? How does that match up? In Singapore,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list -->

<p><ul><li>Investing in a Reit requires a brokerage account, a CDP account, and the transaction fees in buying and selling. There is no capital gain tax nor dividend tax in Singapore. For a physical property, there&rsquo;s the following to think about, on top of time and money spent in e.g. sourcing for tenants:<ul><li>3-4% Buyer Stamp Duty</li><li>12-25% Additional Buyer Stamp Duty</li><li>legal fees</li><li>property tax of ~10% Annual Value</li><li>rental income tax</li><li>maintenance cost</li><li>insurance</li><li>mortgage</li><li>4-12% Seller Stamp Duty</li><li>agent commission</li></ul></li><li>Physical properties are more illquid that the exchange-traded Reit unit</li><li>Due to the price of physical properties, it is unlikely for a retail investor to have say more than 5 or 10 properties, thus incurring concentration risk in location. A well diversified Reit would have no such issues.</li><li>Yield of a Reit is typically in the 4-8% range, while it could be challenging to replicate or better this yield from a physical property.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<p><h3>(Good to know) Reits versus Business trusts, stapled securities</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Not all the counters you see on SGX that seem like Reits, are actually Reits. For example, Ascendas Reit (<a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/A17U.SI/">A17U.SI</a>) is a Reit, while Ascendas Htrust (<a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/Q1P.SI">Q1P.SI</a>) is a <strong>stapled security</strong>, i.e. one unit of Q1P constitutes buying into the Ascendas Hospitality Real Estate Trust plus the Ascendas Hospitality Business Trust. Think of it as stapling two pieces of paper together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>From a regulatory standpoint, there are significant differences between a Reit and a business trust. This <a href="https://www.reitas.sg/singapore-reits/differences-between-s-reits-business-trusts-in-singapore/">REITAS page</a> (<a href="https://www.reitas.sg/">REITAS</a> is short for REIT Association of Singapore) is clear on the differences. For retail investors, it would be good to be cognizant of the following (lifted from the same page):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:table -->

<p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Reit</strong></td><td><strong>Business Trust</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Distribution</strong></td><td>Reits must distribute at least 90% of their specified income to their unitholders to enjoy tax transparency under the Income Tax Act.</td><td>There is no statutory requirement to distribute a certain percentage of its income, but business trusts may pledge to distribute a certain percentage of income to their unitholders. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gearing</strong></td><td>The Code on Collective Investment Schemes sets a 45% cap on gearing.</td><td>There is no statutory gearing limit, but business trusts may commit to a self-imposed borrowing limit.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>In a stapled security, all Reits regulation (e.g. the Income Tax Act and the Code on Collective Investment Schemes) apply to the Reit portion only. The business trust is nothing but a company, regulated under typical public company regulations.</p>

<p><p>And that&rsquo;s all for the Part 1 of this 101, stay tuned for Part 2 :)</p>

<p><p>This is Part 2 from the post &ldquo;<a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2019/01/13/a-guide-to-dollar-cost-averaging-in-singapore-part-1/">A guide to dollar cost averaging in Singapore â€“ Part 1</a>&rdquo;. Be sure to check that out first before going further here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>In my previous post back in January 2019, I introduced the various Regular Savings Plans (RSP) that can be used to do automated dollar cost averaging (DCA) in Singapore, namely:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<p><ol><li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/investments/investing-in-funds/invest-saver">POSB Invest-Saver</a>&nbsp;(IS)</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/bluechip.html">OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan</a>&nbsp;(BCIP)</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poems.com.sg/rsp/">Phillip POEMS Shares Builder Plan</a>&nbsp;(SBP)</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maybank-ke.com.sg/latest-offerings/listing/sgd0-commission-with-monthly-investment-plan/">Maybank Kim Eng Monthly Investment Plan</a>&nbsp;(MIP)</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I also started analyzing each of these RSPs, based on the following criteria:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<p><ol><li>Range of counters available <em>- covered in Part 1</em></li><li>Transaction fees and minimum charges <em>- covered in Part 1</em></li><li>Dividend reinvestment <em>- covered in Part 1</em></li><li>Payment modes and order execution<em> - covered in Part 1</em></li><li>Selling and other hidden fees</li><li>Other factors of consideration</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->

<p><h2>5. Selling and other hidden fees</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Selling shares is not typically explained in great detail, as most DCA-ers are looking for long-term, buy-and-hold type of investing system. That said, it is still important to understand the fees associated with selling your shares, as well as other hidden fees that are buried in the terms and conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>Selling shares</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:table -->

<p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Selling transaction fees</strong></td></tr><tr><td>IS</td><td><a href="https://dollarsandsense.sg/posb-invest-saver-heres-automatically-invest-strongest-singapore-companies-bonds-every-month/">None</a></td></tr><tr><td>BCIP</td><td><a href="https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/bluechip.html#fees"> 0.30% of the total sales proceeds or S$5 per counter, whichever is higher </a></td></tr><tr><td>SBP</td><td>Same as <a href="https://www.poems.com.sg/products/stocks/">POEMS</a> itself</td></tr><tr><td>MIP</td><td>Same as <a href="https://www.maybank-ke.com.sg/pricing/pricing-listing/stocks/">KE</a> itself</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>Other hidden fees</strong> - this is largely driven by my personal experience with these products! Which means there could be things that I have missed out e.g. BCIP</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list -->

<p><ul><li>IS: None that I know of - IS is a really simple and efficient product to work with :)</li><li>BCIP: I don&rsquo;t use BCIP, so I don&rsquo;t have any hands-on experience with it</li><li>SBP: <strong>Dividend charges</strong> - while it is listed <a href="https://www.poems.com.sg/docs/SBP-Infosheet.pdf">here </a>that dividends are charged at 1% with a minimum of $1 capped at $50, what&rsquo;s not mentioned is that this dividend charge is applied <strong>per dividend line item</strong>. For example, just last month (March 2019), Mapletree Industrial Trust (ME8U) did their <a href="http://www.mapletreeindustrialtrust.com/en/Investor-Relations/Distribution/Distribution-History.aspx">3QFY18/19 and advanced 4QFY18/19 distribution, at 3.07 cents and 1.71 cents per unit</a>, on pay dates of 8th March and 26th March respectively. However, due to either legal or tax reasons that I have yet to understand fully, typical REIT dividend distributions are split across multiple line items, such as that listed <a href="https://www.dividends.sg/view/ME8U">here</a>. As such and rather incredulously, the SBP dividend charge is applied across each line item. What&rsquo;s more, for every line item that do not meet the $1 minimum, the entire dividend line item is forfeited. Therefore, the best way to really mitigate this is to accumulate sufficient units and transfer them into your CDP ($20.40 per counter inclusive of GST) when the time comes. I did write to Phillip complaining about the application of the dividend charge in this manner, but I didn&rsquo;t manage to effect any change. To be honest, in view of the cheap SBP transaction fees relative to actual monthly DCA execution via other means, I will just have to live with this for now.</li><li>MIP: based on my experience, the MIP in itself is rather transparent. The thing to note here however, is that the associated KE Prefunded account comes with its set of charges and fees, such as the <a href="https://www.maybank-ke.com.sg/pricing/pricing-listing/stocks/">foreign custody fee</a> for non-CDP securities. In my view, these charges are fairly reasonable by Singapore market standards.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->

<p><h2>6. Other factors of consideration</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>It must be mentioned that the factors that I am listing below must be weighed against all the prior pointers, especially transaction fees. For example, low transaction fees could jolly well compensate for bad user experience, depending of course on how low is low and how bad is bad. It&rsquo;s all subjective anyway. Also, goes without saying that a good user experience is preferable to a bad one, ceteris paribus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>POSB IS is definitely the easiest to work with and get started</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>IS is hands-down the simplest of the gang to get started with investing and DCA. First of all, it is probably accurate to say that every Singaporean son and daughter has a POSB account of some sorts, likely to be the Savings account. That&rsquo;s already half the requirements for IS - the other half is to have iBanking. After which you can simply log on and kick start the RSP. No additional account, no GIRO arrangements, no additional platform or portal to log on. No fuse no nothing. And it&rsquo;s really transparent in terms of  transaction costs. For these reasons, IS is my favorite for its pure and joyful simplicity. POSB Savings account + IS was also how I got started as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>By extension, even though I don&rsquo;t have any hands-on experience with the BCIP, I can imagine it to be as simple as the IS within OCBC internet banking, relative to the SBP or MIP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>The DBS/POSB iBanking user experience is not be taken granted for</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>If you are like me and never had prior experience in using any other internet banking platforms beyond DBS and OCBC, then you would really take their UI/UX (user interface/user experience) for granted. While the POEMS platform is what I would deemed as acceptable, the KE platform is rather horrendous. I am no UX expert but there are definitely plenty of areas of improvements for both POEMS and KE. You can stick a query into Google Images to sneak a peek at both. I could feel like I was using a Bloomberg terminal with way less platform capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>What IS lacks in ETF and general coverage, SBP and MIP more than makes up for it</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>That said, IS only provides two ETFs, the <a href="https://www.nikkoam.com.sg/etf/sti">G3B</a> and <a href="https://www.nikkoam.com.sg/etf/abf">A35</a>. Even for a <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios">lazy portfolio</a> consideration, this is insufficient. A Singaporean lazy portfolio could look like something like <a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2018/09/16/book-review-rich-by-retirement-by-joshua-giersch/">IWDA.LN + ES3 + A35</a>, or any other variation on global equity exposure, local equity exposure, local bond exposure (e.g. <a href="https://www.nikkoam.com.sg/etf/sgd-investment-grade-corp-bond">MBH</a>), with or without EM exposure (e.g. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EIMI:LN">EIMI.LN</a>), small cap exposure or alternatives exposure (e.g. REITs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>With this, IS is in itself definitely insufficient even for the laziest of portfolios. In terms of ETF coverage, both SBP and MIP is much broader, allowing DCA access into <a href="https://www.spdrs.com.sg/etf/fund/spdr-straits-times-index-etf-ES3.html">ES3</a>, A35, MBH, <a href="http://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/funds/lion-phillip-s-reit-etf/index.html">CLR</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.phillipfunds.com/home/sing-income-etfs">OVQ</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>(In particular, OVQ is one that I particular watched and took a slightly <a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2018/10/20/analysis-of-the-phillip-sing-income-etf/">deeper look</a>. It&rsquo;s also my <a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2019/04/06/portfolio-update-q1-2019/">largest position to date</a>.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Therefore, it seems ideal to complement IS with either of SBP and MIP (MIP especially for DCA access to non-SGX securities), or simply skip IS all together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>IS can be used to fulfill DBS Multiplier Investment component, while SBP/MIP GIRO deductions can be used to fulfill GIRO bill payment requirements for OCBC 360 etc.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>This one is trivial. New IS applications count towards the Invest component of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/landing/dbs-multiplier/" target="_blank">DBS Multiplier account</a>, but only for the first 12 months of transactions. (If you already had IS running off another DBS/POSB account, simply switching the funding account to the DBS Multipler account counts as a &ldquo;new IS application&rdquo;.) On the other hand, GIRO deductions used to fund the SBP or MIP can count as bill payments for accounts like OCBC 360 and UOB One.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p><strong>Finally, my personal implementation of DCA includes the IS, SBP, and MIP.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I decided early on that the BCIP seems expensive relative to the others. Having started out with IS, I now use IS for G3B and A35, SBP for OVQ, MBH, and a variety of REITs and stocks, and MIP for <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ?p=JNJ">JNJ.N</a>. You can take a catch a snapshot of my current portfolio <a href="https://thestatsguy.home.blog/2019/04/06/portfolio-update-q1-2019/">here</a>. That said, what that works for me may not work for you. Do your own research!</p>

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly re-reading Marcus Aurelius&amp;rsquo; Meditations, and this line caught my attention once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; our will rules its own domain. Otherwise the harm they [other people] do would cause harm to me. Which is not what God intended —for my happiness to rest with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a religious person by any means, but this line in Meditations does resonate with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius&amp;rsquo; Meditations is well known to be one of the cornerstone texts underpinning the philosophy of Stoicism. In order to understand better what Marcus Aurelius was saying, let me briefly explain a key Stoic principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary principles in Stoicism is the separation between factors that are within your control, and factors that are beyond your control. Stoics advocate for the acceptance of whatever fate brings, i.e. outside of your control (&lt;em&gt;Amor Fati&lt;/em&gt; - Latin for &amp;ldquo;love your fate&amp;rdquo;). This includes many things in life - the unexpected cancer or car accident, the unfaithful spouse - and certainly include the actions, thoughts, emotions, and words of other people. Treat these external factors objectively, and accept them in your stride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies for both the good and the bad. As long as they are beyond your control, we should be as humble, graceful, and accepting as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being upset by the opinions of others, for example, is a futile exercise as you cannot control how others think. Likewise, the fame and glory that we seek is also a function of the opinions&amp;rsquo; of others - hardly something we control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, people in your lives come and go - but your will, your mind, your thoughts will stay with you for as long as you live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Stoic teachings tell us to solely focus on factors that we can indeed control. This includes how we think, what we speak, how we spend our time, how hard we work and study, how healthily we eat, how much we exercise, how much time we spend with our loved ones. By focusing our attention on these controllable factors, not only will we be at peace, we will also be steadily improving our lives as we hustle along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what Marcus Aurelius was trying to say to himself: &amp;ldquo;our will rules its own domain&amp;rdquo;, actions by others does not harm us - our happiness rest with ourselves, not others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it is our minds, thoughts, and actions that bring us happiness, and nothing else. This should be a liberating idea, to say the least. We do not need the right spouse or the right career or the right house or the right &amp;ldquo;fill in the blank&amp;rdquo; to be happy. Marcus Aurelius himself was a Roman Emperor (and one of the better ones at his job) and ruled over Rome for close to two decades - yet he attributes none of his authority and wealth to the peace and happiness he enjoyed&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:In-fact-he-was-r&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:In-fact-he-was-r&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our happiness is within our control. The question then is - what we can do on our
end, i.e. factors that we can control, to help ourselves achieve this happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:In-fact-he-was-r&#34;&gt;In fact, he was rather explicit in Meditations that the Stoic philosophy he practiced was to help him cope with the authority that he had as a Roman Emperor. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:In-fact-he-was-r&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Do Less, Better</title>

&lt;!-- wp:quote --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the simple recipe for improvement and for happiness. It comes from Marcus Aurelius and the fact that it came from such a busy man with so many obligations and responsibilities should not be forgotten.&amp;nbsp;“&lt;strong&gt;If you seek tranquility&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said, “&lt;strong&gt;do less.&lt;/strong&gt;”&amp;nbsp;And then he follows the note to himself with some clarification. Not nothing, less. &lt;strong&gt;Do only what’s essential.&lt;/strong&gt; “Which brings a double satisfaction,” he writes “to do less, better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow this advice today and everyday. So much of what we think we must do, so much of what we end up doing is not essential. We do it out of habit. We do it out of guilt. We do it out of laziness or we do it out of greedy ambition. And then we wonder why our performance suffers. We wonder why our heart isn’t really in it.&amp;nbsp;Of course it isn’t. &lt;strong&gt;We know deep down there’s no point&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;But if we could do less inessential stuff, &lt;strong&gt;we’d be able to better do what is essential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d also get a taste of that tranquility that Marcus was talking about. A double satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Daily Stoic&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:quote --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transcript above (emphasis my own) comes from one of the recent episodes in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dailystoic.com/podcast/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Daily Stoic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; podcast, talking about the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WiVTsMI5oBoipBEZB4Q3X&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do Less, Better&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; . In this modern age of rapid information and content flow day in, day out, we might sometimes find ourselves lost in figuring out our true objectives in life. There seems to be too many things to work on and optimize, with too little time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What then, is (in)essential?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to comprehend the underlying message at first glance - focus on what&amp;rsquo;s essential (do less), and do them well (better). What then, would be considered essential? Well, for most people, it would along the lines of health, wealth, family and friends, etc.  As I reflect on my experiences and perspective in life today, these are the things that I deem are essential to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My health - maintaining my health with diet and exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My livelihood - increasing my proficiency and knowledge in data science and machine learning, as this is my current and (very likely) future livelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My family and friends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading and writing - the best outlets for thoughts, reflections, analysis, and planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My finances - investing well, seeking sustainable, feasible passive and alternative income. Instead of trading time for money like everyone in this modern rat race of life, choose to trade money for time and experience in this world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My skills - self-sufficient skills that reasonably reduces living expenses and my reliance on society and others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,  I find it a lot more instructive in this case to think about what then would be inessential? Think about that for a moment. What is inessential in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, there is a clear relationship between essential/inessential and needs/wants. Inessential things are things that you don&amp;rsquo;t need, but they became talking points and occupy your &amp;ldquo;brainspace&amp;rdquo; in the first place simply because you want these things. And there are many things out there that induces a sense of want, though they are not necessarily needed. This is especially so on the typical social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, to be truly efficient and satisfied, identify things that you might once thought you really need, but not necessarily so. Then, &lt;strong&gt;Do Less&lt;/strong&gt; - focus on the essential, and do them &lt;strong&gt;Better&lt;/strong&gt;. Spend your waking time and your physical and mental energy on them to optimize or master them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am in this stage in my life right now where my focus in life gets sharper as time passes. Yes, sometimes I do get a little lost and confused, especially when my mental guard is down. However, that sense of tranquility will always kick in when you realize that at the end of the day, your time has been well-spent, improving, optimizing, and mastering the essential, while weeding out the inessential. It is indeed a satisfying experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sleepless night, so I decided to write a little. This will be the first part of a series that I would like to write about, circling around the use of statistical methods in finance. Most of the content that I will be exploring would originate from one of my NUS M.Sc Statistics modules, Advanced Statistical Methods in Finance. I was taught by Prof Xia Yingcun when I did this module.</description>

      <description>In this post, I would like to give an overview of the principles and concepts in the fundamental analysis of stocks.
What is fundamental analysis? Well, fundamental analysis (FA) is the analysis of the fundamentals of a company. The fundamentals of the company are trying to capture essentially the health of the company, in the present and future. The objective of FA is to discern a point of view on the current and future prospects of a company – the actionability from this point of view is of course whether to buy (or short-sell) the stock.</description>

      <guid>/2019/04/04/stylized-facts-in-statistical-finance/</guid>
      <description>In statistical finance (as well as in certain areas in social science), stylized facts are empirical observations summarized in a theory-like form, and are generally representative under broad circumstances.
Stylized facts are commonly used in statistical finance to address and summarize phenomenon directly observed from historical data, and explainable with a certain level of theoretical consistency and logic (&#34;... this makes sense to me&#34;). Stylized facts may often guide investigations and explorations into certain topics of interest, functioning perhaps as assumptions to be either built upon or proven otherwise.</description>

      <description>Inversion of US Treasury yield spread. Source.  With the US Treasury yield curve inverting for the first time since 2007, we have our first reliable signal from the market that a recession is around the corner, perhaps by 2021 or earlier.
From a simple retail investing standpoint, an impending recession means that we want to stash away cash, and perhaps load some of it into our brokerage accounts when the fire sale swings by.</description>

      <description>The Singapore Savings Bonds programme
Been a while since I last posted on my blog - the last month or so has been hectic for me, with the semester final examinations for my part-time Masters as well as travelling for business. Still, no excuses for slipping on my 2 posts per month commitment, so will try to make up for it in December.
Also, quick update: following my analysis of the various deposit accounts here and here, I went ahead and opened my DBS Multiplier account online, together with the DBS Live Fresh credit card.</description>

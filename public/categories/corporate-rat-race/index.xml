      <description>Two things I want to talk about here: how travelling affects productivity and how to alleviate some of its effects.

 The need for power (n-Pow) The need for achievement (n-Ach) The need for affiliation (n-Aff)  I first encountered this idea in the book Managing Scientists: Leadership Strategies in Scientific Research by Alice Sapienza, which I have yet to finish reading.</description>
